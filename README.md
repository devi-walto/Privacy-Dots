# Privacy-Dots
The **Privacy Dots** system uses motion-detecting nodes that send signals to a central **Django** server whenever motion is detected. The server processes these signals and sends real-time push notifications to users through the **Privacy Dots App**, alerting them about activity. The mobile app receives these notifications providing users with a quick and easy way to monitor their devices.
For more information on the mobile app, visit the [Privacy Dots App Repository](https://github.com/dieg00tfb/Privacy-Dots-App).
